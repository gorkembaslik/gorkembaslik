### Hi, I'm Gorkem 👋



[cite_start]I'm a Computer Science M.S. student at the University of Milan [cite: 9, 10] [cite_start]with a passion for **backend development** and building **scalable, high-performance systems**[cite: 6].

[cite_start]My background is in Computer Engineering [cite: 15][cite_start], and I'm driven to build and optimize fault-tolerant tools and APIs[cite: 8]. [cite_start]I have a strong interest in the **Fintech** [cite: 60] [cite_start]and **automation** sectors [cite: 8] and am actively seeking junior backend developer roles.

* 🎓 Studying **M.S. Computer Science** at Università degli Studi di Milano.
* [cite_start]🚀 I thrive on a **"bias for action"** [cite: 27][cite_start]—in my last role, I engineered a data pipeline that cut processing time by over 85% and delivered the project 2 months ahead of schedule[cite: 25, 27].
* [cite_start]💡 I'm currently deepening my knowledge in: **Docker** [cite: 38][cite_start], **advanced REST API design**, and **New Generation DBMSs**[cite: 12].
* [cite_start]📫 You can reach me at **gorkembaslik@gmail.com** [cite: 4] or on [**LinkedIn**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/baslik).
